            <h1>THE HISTORY</h1>
            <p5>The research team of STEM PTECH 12-A at Taguig City University has six members: Tolentino, Tomas, Salazar, Tortogo, Trapane, and Perez. <br>In the capstone research subject, this project has been accepted by Professor Jeric T. Nuez as their research study for the end of the final<br> semester. This web-based version was created with the code editor Brackets, free and open-source software licensed under the MIT License. <br>The researchers used a tool called HTML, which is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. <br>Next is CSS, a simple mechanism for adding style like fonts, colors, and spacing to Web documents. Lastly is JavaScript, which is a scripting<br>language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else,<br> they used these tools to complete the whole operation of a program.</p5>
